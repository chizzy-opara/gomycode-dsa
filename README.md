# Algorithms and Data Structures

An algorithm is a sequence of instructions written by a computer programmer in order to guide a computer to solve a problem. As an analogy, consider recipes in the real world cuisine. A recipe is a list of instruction that a chef follows in order to cook a meal.

In order to write a good computer program, the algorithms employed (or created) must be correct, which means the steps must lead to the right solution without errors.

## How to write algorithms

Technically, algorithms are written in programming languages. However, for the sake of simplifying a solution without needing to worry about the nuances or complexity of code, algorithms are also written as pseudocodes or flowcharts.

### Pseudocode

A pseudocode (or fake-code) is a close-to-english representation of an instruction. It allows you to write algorithms by listing the steps as plain english sentences without worry for syntax/code technicalities. A pseudocode may also be structured in a way to resemble actual code, but compared to actual code, a pseudocode is easier to read and understand. This is an example of a [structured] pseudocode, the algo syntax or format:

```
ALGORITHM addTwoNumbers

VAR
  firstNumber: INTEGER
  secondNumber: INTEGER

BEGIN
  Read(firstNumber)
  Read(SecondNumber)
  sum := firstNumber + secondNumber
  Write(sum)
END
```

> We specify the name of the algorithm (the first line), declaration of variables with respective datatypes indented under `VAR`, and the actual list of steps indented between `BEGIN` and `END`.

### Flowcharts

Flowcharts are diagrams (geometric shapes with arrows) used to explain the flow of a program or an algorithm. Programmers use flowcharts to present their algorithms in a more friendly way.
